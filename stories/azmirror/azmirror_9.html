<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was still dark when a group of three volunteers came across a dirt lot in west Phoenix on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the cars speeding down McDowell Road in the early morning hours of Jan. 28, the clandestine shelter probably looked like trash, if it was noticed at all. But for the volunteers, trained to spot homeless encampments, it was what they had been searching for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volunteers approached the cardboard shelter slowly and cautiously. “Is that a guy?” one whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man had stood up, poking his head out from behind the cardboard wall. After exchanging a few words, the man who identified himself as Adrian invited them to approach, introducing his girlfriend Pam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One volunteer began asking Adrian a series of survey questions. “How old are you?”, “Where did you sleep last night?”, “How long have you been experiencing homelessness?”, “Do you have any medical conditions?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every one of them,” Adrian said to the last question. The 60-year-old had been dealing with heart problems and a knee injury that doctors had been unable to diagnose. Trips to specialists swallowed his money, and he and Pam wound up on the street 17 months ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volunteer asked Adrian why they hadn’t tried to secure a spot in a homeless shelter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every time we call, they say they’re full,” he said. “We just got tired of asking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team of volunteers gave the couple their well-wishes, and left them with a list of resources that might be able to provide help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the morning, the team scoured industrial complexes, abandoned fields, parking lots and residential neighborhoods to count as many people as they could find who spent the previous night unsheltered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, counties across the U.S. participate in the Point-In-Time Homeless Count, a sort of census for those living on the streets or in shelters on one night out of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The count is organized by the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG). Hundreds of volunteers are split up into groups and assigned their own “grid.” The data that volunteers collect across the 9,000 square miles of Maricopa County is tabulated by MAG before it’s passed along to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development sometime in May, which is when the data will become available to the public. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “snapshot,” not an exact science</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone familiar with the count will tell you that it’s not a perfect science. The data collected every January is meant to serve as a “snapshot” of homelessness, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Schwabenlender, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive director of the Human Services Campus, located in downtown Phoenix. The campus connects people experiencing homelessness to a variety of resources including housing, legal services and employment help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The Point-In-Time Homeless Count) allows the community to see if there are major trends year over year,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwabenlender said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, 6,614 people were counted, a number that has slowly increased since 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwabenlender, however, is hopeful that the upward trend won’t continue this year. The coalition of agencies she oversees haven’t seen an increased need over the past year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m optimistic that the total will be about flat,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she’s less sure about the proportion of unsheltered individuals, who can be more difficult to track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hard for me to judge what I see from my window,” she said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proportion of unsheltered homeless people has been increasing since 2014, ballooning to nearly half of all individuals counted in 2019. Those considered “unsheltered” are people who have spent the previous night in a place unfit for human habitation, like on a park bench or in a vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides being a requirement for the Human Services Campus to receive federal funding, the count also provides communities with information on homlessness in their area. “I think some folks don’t want to believe they have homeless in their community,” S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chwabenlender </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s helpful … to demonstrate to all those cities and towns in Maricopa County that people are experiencing homelessness everywhere,” she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not just a Phoenix problem.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">New developments </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years, the Maricopa Association of Governments piloted a survey app to replace the traditional clipboards and pencils. This year’s count was the first time the app version was rolled out across the county, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shantae Smith, a human services planner with MAG.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This app can help us provide real-time data” on the location of unsheltered homeless individuals, Smith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing and Urban Development provides a list of questions, but counties are allowed to add their own, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, volunteers asked individuals over the age of 18 if they had ever been in foster care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anecdotally, quite a few have had foster care involvements,” Smith said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was updated in 2019 to include pets in the count of unsheltered individuals, a question that remained on this year’s survey. Last year, 182 pets were found on the streets accompanying their owners, including 10 service animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, pets can be an obstacle in finding temporary or permanent housing, Smith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the reason Shauna and her husband, Avi, both 33, are sleeping on the street rather than staying in a shelter. It’s because of “that beautiful girl right there,” said Shauna, pointing to their 9-month-old brown and white pitbull named Callie Bear – “like a California Brown Bear,” Shauna said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most homeless shelters do not accept animals, and even permanent housing options are often pet-restrictive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People experiencing homelessness typically don’t have the resources to pay costly pet deposits or fully vaccinate their animals, Smith said, and many are unwilling to part with their animal companions in order to secure housing. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disconnected funding systems </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of homeless individuals identified in the Point-In-Time count does not translate into proportionate federal funding dollars – that’s not how it works, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwabenlender said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counties across the U.S. are in competition for funding from Housing and Urban Development, and there’s only so much money to go around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When homeless numbers go up, that can cause applications to HUD to lose points, which means the organization could receive less funding, or have more difficulty in funding new projects, said Schwabenlender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HUD is not the Human Services Campus’s sole funding stream – it relies on a patchwork of systems to fund projects – but these systems aren’t necessarily coordinating,  Schwabenlender said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The funding streams are all separate … overall, these big systems aren’t really linked in my opinion,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know that anyone is actually looking at the whole picture at one time.”</span></p>
