<p>The pilot program, set to last six months, will see e-scooters deployed between Seventh Avenue and Seventh Street, and from McDowell Road to Buckeye Road, as well as the area bound by Roosevelt and Grant Streets.</p>
<p>Back in May, Phoenix City Council voted to end their dockless bike share program in favor of e-scooters. Docked bikes, such as the green-colored Grid bikes found near light rail stops, will not be affected by the change.</p>
<p>E-scooters have already made their way to cities around the Valley, including Tempe, where ASU eventually banned the dockless scooters from riding through campus.</p>

<p>The city of Phoenix plans to impose restrictions on e-scooter usage.</p>
<p>Riders must be 18 years or older with a valid driver’s license, and use of helmets will be “encouraged,” according to Street Transportation Assistant Director Briiana Velez, who presented the pilot to City Council<span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #111111; font-family: 'Segoe UI',Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif; font-size: 18px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 1.33em; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">. </span></p>
<p>Riding on sidewalks will also be prohibited, and riders may not exceed 15 miles per hour. <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/06/21/bird-electric-scooters-rental-costs-hours-charging-locations/720893002/">According to IndyStar</a>, Bird scooters reach about 15 miles per hour while Lime scooters can reach up to 20 miles per hour.</p>
<p>According to Velez, the city planners have identified 400 locations where the dockless scooters can be placed.</p>
<p>The contract period will begin on Sept. 16 and end March 15, 2020, but could possibly be extended an additional six months. Each private e-scooter vendor can deploy no more than 300 scooters each.</p>
<p>The city has said it will be monitoring e-scooter activity and considering public input during the trial period.</p>
