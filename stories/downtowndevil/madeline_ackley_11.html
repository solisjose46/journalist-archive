<!-- content --><p>Downtown Devil has been my home for almost two years, ever since I attended my first reporters’ meeting, anxious and unsure of myself. I was already in my third year at Cronkite and I had yet to publish anything in my name. I loved the idea of journalism, but imagining myself as one filled me with anxiety. </p>
<p>Since that first meeting, I’ve stuck with Downtown Devil, first as a reporter and later as an editor. It was Downtown Devil that gave me the space to grow into the reporter I am today. It’s been an honor to work alongside a group of such phenomenal journalists and even better humans. I am continuously blown away by the incredible work of my colleagues and the dedication of our executive staff. </p>
<p>I am also grateful to the amazing people I’ve met through my reporting. Thank you for sharing a piece of yourself with me and for letting me tell your story. I hope I did you justice. </p>
<p>Thank you to our loyal readers. Whether you’re a fan or a hater or a little bit of both, thanks for reading our little college rag. We’d be nothing without you. </p>
<p>And thank you to our present and future Downtown Devil staff. In the age of declining local news, you are a rare and essential independent voice. Downtown Phoenix is a place with great nuance and endless stories to pursue. It’s also a place experiencing rapid change, and not always for the better. May you amplify the voices of the unheard, hold the powerful accountable and always tell the truth. I cannot wait to read your excellent coverage for years to come!</p>
