   Downtown Phoenix’s newest farmers market debuted Wednesday at the Arizona Center, hosting around 35 vendors selling local food and homemade goods.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   The mid-week market, which will be held from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. each Wednesday in the grotto of the Arizona Center, mainly offers food items, but jewelry, beauty products and crafts are in stock, too.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   The market also provides another opportunity for downtown residents to shop locally.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   “When you spend your money locally, the money stays here,” said
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Salomon Aliser, an
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   organizer of the farmers market. “We’ve come to add to Phoenix… to add more opportunities for our vendors to be in front of people.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Aliser has a passion for the vendors he works with. “Everyone has a great story,” he said. “I see their struggles, I see their victories. It’s just a great feeling.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   At the farmers market, vendors and patrons alike shared in their passion for the local and handmade.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Phoenix resident Alyssa Paz, who frequents other farmers markets around the Valley, heard about the new market on social media.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   “It’s usually better quality and sometimes a lot cheaper,” Paz said of the local marketplaces. Paz added that she enjoys the community aspect of the events as well.

   Sarah Richetto of Crooked Sky Farms stood at her booth, a plethora of greens, citrus fruits and vegetables laid out on the folding tables.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   “We love the farmers market,” said Richetto, who works as a farm manager for the Phoenix-based company. “We try to [pick] most things for the farmers market that day because then it’s the ultimate freshness.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   So far, Crooked Sky Farms is the only produce vendor selling at the market along with two vendors who specialize in microgreens. Aliser hopes to expand to include more vendors and farmers as business begins to grow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   According to the USDA, farmers markets can play an important role in increasing access to fresh produce, especially in low-income areas.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Some farmers markets accept SNAP benefits, formally called food stamps, for fresh produce. Aliser says he intends on applying to accept the program.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Because of the city’s rapid growth in recent years, he’s optimistic that a mid-week farmers market is viable and thinks the Arizona Center is the perfect location to host such an event.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   The Arizona Center Farmers Market is not the only open-air grocery available to downtown residents. The Phoenix Public Market off of Central Avenue and McKinley Street opens every Saturday morning, year-round since 2005.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   “You see everybody’s craftsmanship, their art, their skill,” said Chloe Matthews, a vendor who makes hand-crafted candles,  “I feel at home every time I’m at the farmers market.”
